# Subset Graph Visualization

This project generates a subset graph for a given list of elements and visualizes it. The graph uses directed edges to represent the relationships between subsets, and the empty set is displayed using the mathematical symbol (∅).

---

## Features

- Generates subsets for a given set of elements.
- Creates a directed graph illustrating subset relationships.
- Uses "∅" to represent the empty set.
- Visualizes the graph with `networkx` and `matplotlib`.
