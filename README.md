# Subset Graph Visualization

This project generates a subset graph for a given list of elements and visualizes it. The graph uses directed edges to represent the relationships between subsets, and the empty set is displayed using the mathematical symbol (∅).

---

## Features

- Generates subsets for a given set of elements.
- Creates a directed graph illustrating subset relationships.
- Uses "∅" to represent the empty set.
- Visualizes the graph with `networkx` and `matplotlib`.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.12 or later**
2. The following Python libraries:
   - `networkx`
   - `matplotlib`

---

## Installation

### Clone or Download the Script

1. Download the script file `subset.py` to your local machine.
2. Save it in a directory you can access from the terminal.

---

### Install Dependencies

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```

### Running the script
1. Navigate to the path where the script is saved
cd /path/to/your/script

## Usage

### Customize Input

The script uses `[1, 2, 3]` as the default input. To try a different input:

1. Open the `subset.py` file in any text editor.
2. Navigate to **line 55**, where the input list is defined:
   ```python
   elements = [1, 2, 3]  # input elements
   ```
   Note: The graph can get very messy for big inputs.

2. Run the script
python subset.py

# Pascal's Triangle Generator

This program generates and displays Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept used to represent coefficients in the binomial expansion and to compute combinations (`n choose k`).

## Features
- Generates Pascal's Triangle up to any number of rows.
- Displays the triangle in a visually centered format for better readability.
- Includes explanations for Pascal's Triangle and its mathematical significance.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the folder where the script is located.

3. Run the program using Python:

   ```bash
   python pascals_triangle.py
